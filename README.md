## Sample Output

The application generates rich analytics from library data:

### Format Distribution
```
+------------+----+
| Book       | 13 |
| EBOOK      | 3  |
| Paperback  | 3  |
| Board Book | 1  |
+------------+----+
```

### Top Rated Books (Bayesian Weighted)
```
+------------------------------------------+------------------+------+
| The Hunger Games                         | Collins, Suzanne | 4.5  |
| Hello, Baby Animals: A High-contrast... | Mora, Julissa    | 4.09 |
| "The Right Word in the Right Place...   | Safire, William  | 4.08 |

## Advanced Features

### Bayesian Rating System
Implements sophisticated weighted averaging to provide more reliable ratings for books with varying review counts:

```python
bayesian_avg = (v / (v + m)) * R + (m / (v + m)) * C
# Where: v=votes, R=rating, m=minimum votes, C=mean rating
```

### Intelligent Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing data fields
- Automatic retry mechanisms for failed scraping attempts  
- Comprehensive logging and error reporting

### Production-Grade Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component validation
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing
- **Fixture Management**: Reusable test data and cleanup
- **Coverage Reporting**: Detailed metrics via Codecov

## Generated Visualizations

The application creates four distinct chart types:

1. **Format Distribution**: Pie chart showing book format breakdown
2. **Publication Timeline**: Line plot of publication year trends  
3. **Author Frequency**: Horizontal bar chart of prolific authors
4. **Rating Analysis**: Scatter plot correlating ratings with review counts

## 🔧 Configuration & Deployment

### Environment Setup
```bash
# System dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install google-chrome-stable

# Python dependencies
pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 matplotlib requests lxml
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated testing across Python 3.8-3.11
- Code quality checks (Black, isort, Flake8, MyPy)
- Coverage reporting and artifact generation
- Cross-platform compatibility testing

## 📋 Usage Examples

### Basic Search
```python
from src import LibraryDB, scrape_library_data, generate_charts

library_db = LibraryDB()
library_db.create_table()
scrape_library_data(library_db, "science fiction")
generate_charts(library_db, "science fiction")
```

### Advanced Analytics
```python
# Get statistical insights
top_authors = library_db.get_top_authors_weighted()
format_dist = library_db.get_format_data()
publication_trends = library_db.get_pub_year_data()
```
